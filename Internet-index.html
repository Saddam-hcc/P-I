  <h1>What is the internet</h1>
  <h3>Definition of Internet </h3>
  <p>
      The Internet is a huge global network that connects billions of computers and phones to each other around the world. You can imagine it as a "network of networks" that allows the exchange of data, information and files between any two devices connected to it.
    </p>
  <h3>How it works</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
  <strong>Communication</strong>: The devices are connected via undersea, satellite, or wireless cables.</li>
  <br><li><strong>Protocols</strong> are the languages used by devices for understanding, the most famous of which is HTTP (used in browsing your current site).
    </li><br>
    <li>
      <strong>Address</strong>: Every device or website has a unique address called IP Address, which allows the data to reach its correct destination.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>The difference between "Internet" and "Web":</h3>
  <p><strong>The Internet</strong> is the "infrastructure" and the wires and devices that connect the world.</p>
  <p><strong>Web</strong> (World Wide Web): It is the "service" that we use to browse websites and it works over the Internet.</p>
